				<h4>Puppy diet</h4>
				<p>For specific amounts, refer to <a href="https://www.grangecoop.com/grangeknows/puppy-feeding-chart.html">this chart</a> as a guide. This section will focus on practices and how to feed your puppy. Always start with soft food. When a puppy doesn't eat when it's hungry, the most common cause is that it can't properly consume or digest the hard food.</p>
				<br>
				<p>A common mistake when feeding your puppy in its first few weeks up to week 6 is to limit the food it has access to. In the puppy stages, the pup will only eat what it needs, so there is no need to have the bowl empty. In fact, it helps to have it filled because the pup will take care of feeding itself when it needs to. Only fill the bowl with soft foods.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Lastly, keep an eye on how much your puppy is consuming. Consult a vet if you are unsure of what to do or need help!</p>

				<h4>Adult diet</h4>
				<p>Adults dogs are quite different. If you can and are willing to, the best food you can give your dogs is homemade food. Common meats and vegetables will work well, be sure to avoid <a href="https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/foods-can-be-poisonous-pets">these</a> foods.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Oddly enough, setting the amount of food aside, a healthy dog diet is not so different from our own healthy diet. As long as it is also mixed with exercise to boost metabolism, the healthiest diet for an adult dog is meats and vegetables.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Luckily, nothing else is really needed. Dogs enjoy the meats and veggies without any extra flavoring, which is another health boost.</p>

				<h3>Important notes to consider</h3>
				<p>Interestingly enough, most breeds of dogs don't require carbohydrates. This being said, dry food is not reccommended and shouldn't be your go-to option when taking care of your beloved pet. Instead, opt for real unprocessed meats and vegetable based food sources.</p>
				<br>
				<p>As long as sufficient protein is provided, carbs are unnecessary and will cause rapid weight gain.</p>
